Revision history for WebService-PayPal-PaymentsAdvanced

{{$NEXT}}

    - The connection timeout was increased to 60 seconds as requests to the
      service frequently run 20-30 seconds.
    - Previously, this API would throw
      WebService::PayPal::PaymentsAdvanced::Error::HTTP exceptions with
      messages indicating that there was an HTTP error when the request failed
      for other reasons such as a timeout. The message should now more
      accurately reflect the cause of the exception.
